# Bunny.prototype
A HTML5 Canvas game featuring a bunny who is always on the lookout for the next carrot.
This was a school project in game design around January 2013 where we were to focus on story, esthetics, game mechanics and technology.

## The concept
The concept was based on the story of a bunny who is in a frenzy for carrots, and loses focus on the one he got when he spot the next one. It is a 2D platform game with a carrot as the main objective, and uses a wall-jumping game mechanic inspired by [Super Meat boy](http://supermeatboy.com/).

## Demo
This was just a prototype created in a short period of time, so there are only four levels and Google Chrome was the only browser I could support. Nevertheless I would love it if you tried out [the prototype](http://einarlove.com/view/bunny/) and [gave feedback](http://twitter.com/einarlove) of what you thought.
