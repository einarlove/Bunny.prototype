# Bunny.prototype
## A prototype for a canvas platform game
------------------
With four levels in this prototype, I was able to experiment with the game mechanics—like wall jumping and traps—to make interesting level designs, and how to teach the mechanics in a cognitive and experimental manner.

My partner was Sara Nilsdóttir Tomter, who was part of the idea creation and process, and stood for most of the graphics.
