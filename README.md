# This is a prototype for a game concept done as a school project in Game Design.

_Compatible with **Chrome**_

### Known bugs
- Can't read multiple key events
- Frame rate drops on computers with inferior CPU than macbooks'

------------------
With four levels in this prototype, I was able to experiment with the game mechanics—like wall jumping and traps—to make interesting level designs, and how to teach the mechanics in a cognitive and experimental manner.

My partner was Sara Nilsdóttir Tomter, who was part of the idea creation and process, and stood for most of the graphics.
